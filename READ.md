Concepts used in this project include:

- DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): These are objects used to transfer data between different layers of the application, such as between the controller and the service layer. They help to encapsulate and organize data in a structured manner.

- Entity Framework Core: This is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that simplifies database access in ASP.NET Core applications. It allows you to work with databases using object-oriented programming concepts, such as using C# classes to represent database tables.

- Async Endpoints: In ASP.NET Core, you can define asynchronous endpoints to handle incoming requests. This allows the server to handle multiple requests concurrently, improving the overall performance and responsiveness of the application.

Feel free to add more details and explanations as needed.
